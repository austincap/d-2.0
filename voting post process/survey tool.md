On the feedback date set, a message is sent out to each user who voted either YES or NO on the legislation seeking feedback. There is always at least one default yes/no question on this survey that reads “Did this legislation measurably improve your community?” The author of the legislation may add as many other yes/no question as he deems necessary. However, the only question that must be answered for the survey data to be tabulated is the default question. The survey tool also automatically collects location data of every user, as well as data from any optional fields the legislation author includes.

After a month of the data collected is then aggregated and placed into graph form automatically. Each user who voted on the legislation receives this graph. The subject of this message is “legislation title” results. The graph also appears on the legislation history page after clicking on a specific piece of legislation.
