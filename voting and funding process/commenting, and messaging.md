Every user can enter a comment below the text of every legislation post on that legislationâ€™s page. The user has the option to reply to previous comments, or highlight portions of the legislation and tie the highlighted portion to his comment. The highlight only shows up when the comment is clicked. Comments can also highlight and reply to other comments. Comments can be made anonymous, but they cannot be edited or deleted after being posted.

A thumbs up button next to each comment allows users to upvote it, increasing visibility and moving it to the top of the legislation post page. All replies to this comment are brought up to the top as well, but they are hidden, unless they also have high upvote counts.
