Account history will allow a user to view any previous legislation he voted on, created, edited, or commented on. It will also allow the user to view all previous comments and messages as well as all legislation posts and comments that he upvoted. While the user can delete any of this from his history, all comments and legislation data will be available for anyone to see by searching for the legislation itself, instead of the user. The user’s name will still be tied to the legislation. Comments deleted from a user’s account history will be made publicly anonymous.

The user can alter the tags, locations, or keywords in the summary or title of legislation can send email alerts. 

The user can input additional information about himself here as well. There are fields for contact information, political affiliation, a picture, occupation, and even a blank space for miscellaneous other information.
