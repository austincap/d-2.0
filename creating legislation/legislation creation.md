Any user can at any time draft a piece of legislation. This requires the user to input a title, the officially accepted name of the political entity impacted by the legislation, a summary, the money required to execute the legislation, a feedback mechanism, feedback date, and a voting date. The two optional fields are details and tags. 

0) The user’s real name, profile, and location are automatically collected and displayed along with the legislation post.

1) The title can be whatever the user wants but must be limited to 500 characters. 

2) The political entity impacted by the legislation must be an existing political entity, such as a country, state, district, county, city, or other.

3) The summary must include the names of companies or individuals where money would go, unless it’s legislation that requires no one be paid, such as abstract laws. This can be as long as it needs to be, but is encouraged to be kept relatively concise. Regardless, commenters will create their own summaries for the legislation.

4) The money required to execute legislation would refer to estimates the legislation drafter had already acquired from the companies the legislation proposes a deal with. To clarify these companies could be anything from construction companies, to private military contractors, to research companies, to experts in a particular field, to environmental protection organization, to farmers, to virtually any other group one would provide with funds in exchange for services. This would necessitate the author of the legislation to draft a contract between the citizenry and these private organizations. This could also concern things like subsidies or the salaries of government officials. When filling out this field the author is given two choices for funding (if a value is entered other than 0): crowdfunding or tax money.

5) The feedback mechanism is a proposed way to determine the effectiveness of said legislation. The entire purpose of legislation is to have impact on society. This is always measurable in some way. It can be anything from a simple survey, to hiring environmental scientists to evaluate ground water, to installing a camera in public to record data. A surveying tool is included in the system is automatically mandatorily implemented, although a different surveying tool can be implemented in addition. The surveying tool automatically messages every voter (both YES and NO voters) with at least the default question “Did this legislation measurably improve your community?”

6) The feedback date is the date when all data collected from the feedback mechanism must be made public for all to see. The feedback report appears on the page where the passed legislation is stored. This date cannot be more than 4 years from the voting date. If the legislation has no measurable impact in 4 years, it probably is not that useful of a piece of legislation. The user is encouraged to make this earlier however.

7) The voting date can be whenever the legislation author wants, so long as it is at least 72 hours after the time of posting the legislation. This is because legislation cannot be altered beginning 72 hours before the start time of the voting date. The voting period itself is always 72 hours as well.

8) Details are any additional information concerning the legislation that is either too long to fit comfortably in the summary or are not text. Details can be almost anything, including movie files, images, databases, traditional legal documents, receipts, blueprints, environmental reports, official approval documents from third party investigators, or anything else relevant the legislation to be passed. When viewing legislation, a “detail viewer” is include below the detail field for ease of use if the file is a text document, picture, or movie.

9) Tags are words or phrases used for ease of location and summarization of the legislation, similar to how hashtags are used on twitter. Anyone at any time can add tags to legislation and anyone can upvote each of these tags once. The top 5 tags are always displayed.
