If a different user finds flaws in the original author’s legislation, he can make edits to the legislation himself, forking it. He can only edit the summary, the money required, the feedback mechanism, and details. He may not change the voting date, the feedback date, the title, or the political entity impacted. All these changes are tracked and tied to the editing user’s name and the time which they were edited. This edited version has the same title as the original legislation with a “version B” added on the end. The editing user has full control over any legislation he makes. If a third user also edits the original legislation, it creates a “version C.” Once the English alphabet is completed once, the letter used to designate the version is “AA”, “AB”, “AC”,…, “BA”, “BB”, “BC”,…, “AAA”, “AAB”, and so on. Other users can edit the “version B” legislation, creating a “version B.B”, “version B.C” and so on. If someone edits the edit of an edit, it will produce “version B.B.B” and so on. 

The original author then has the opportunity to approve these changes, officially changing the original legislation post. He may not accept any edits 72 hours before the beginning of voting time, so everyone knows exactly what they’re voting on at least 3 days prior to voting. The author of version B also has the ability to accept edits made in version B.B, but not in version B.B.B. Only the author of version B.B may accept the edits in version B.B.B. If the author of version B accepts the changes in version B.B, any changes B.B approves from version B.B.B after the fact are not made in addition.

Any version of legislation can be upvoted. If there is a superior edited version that the original legislation author disapproves of, but everyone else prefers the edited version, users have the ability to upvote the new legislation to a higher degree than the original legislation. Come voting day (which cannot be changed from the date and time the original author prescribes) users have the freedom to vote for the edited version instead of the original version, and they may only vote for one version.

In order to legislation to pass, the number of YES votes must be at least 3% higher than the number of NO votes, and vice-versa. In the case of a tie (under 3% difference) nothing would officially pass until a revote that lasts 72 hours from the end of the original voting period. This would continue happening until a clear winner is determined. If the people are so divided that a clear winner cannot be determined, I assert that it is better for no legislation to be passed.

For ease of viewing legislation, users have the option to hide all legislation versions except the top 3 most upvoted from the legislation page. They can browse these different versions at will after clicking on the legislation post.
